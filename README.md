# CMS
This design is a typical CMS layout for use on a big screen. Due to its content, the CMS is designed for large screens. Therefore, this version is not fully responsive and is not dedicated to the small screen. CMS is not intended for small screens at all. Here, we're using Bootstrap as helper technology as one of the components we apply. In this project, in addition to Bootstrap classes, we also use our own classes, including general classes, which we use on subsequent subpages in various elements to give them a similar look, e.g. a common gradient, as well as other tools - such as active elements from Slick.js . A characteristic feature of this method of creating a layout is the use of many individual classes, even for the smallest interface elements, to later refer to them, both in Botstrap and CSS, and thus be able to freely shape them down to the smallest detail. An example is modifying the original modal from Boostrap to suit your needs. You can easily link javascript to such a page in order to give it various functionalities.
